# Summary

This roadmap provides a structured, self-paced curriculum equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate degree in History, condensed into 1–2 years of study at approximately 20 hours per week.

The program emphasizes critical thinking, primary source analysis, and historical interpretation, balancing chronological, regional, and thematic approaches. 


Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).
