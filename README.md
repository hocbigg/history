# Summary

This roadmap provides a structured, self-paced curriculum equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate degree in History, condensed into 1–2 years of study at approximately 20 hours per week.

The program emphasizes critical thinking, primary source analysis, and historical interpretation, balancing chronological, regional, and thematic approaches. 

## Organization

The structure follows a logical progression:

- **Intro**: Builds foundational skills and broad context.
- **Core**: Develops essential knowledge across key periods and methods, equivalent to the first three years of traditional study.
- **Advanced**: Offers specialization tracks for depth, allowing learners to choose 1–2 tracks based on interest.
- **Capstone**: Synthesizes learning through independent application.

Prerequisites ensure sequential learning, with milestones for self-assessment (e.g., reflective essays or quizzes on key concepts). Assume 20 hours/week total; allocate time across concurrent subjects in each semester (e.g., 10 hours each for two subjects). Adjust based on personal pace.

Specialization tracks in the Advanced phase include:

- **Ancient and Classical History**: Focus on early civilizations and foundational empires.
- **European History**: Emphasis on Western developments from medieval to modern eras.
- **American History**: Exploration of North and South American contexts, including colonial and contemporary periods.
- **Global/Non-Western History**: Coverage of Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Oceania, highlighting interconnected global narratives.
- **Thematic History**: Cross-cutting themes like economic, social, cultural, or environmental history.

Learners should select one primary track and optionally one secondary for breadth.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.
